    <h1>üìä Rachel's Investment Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Rachel focuses on technology-based investments. Click a card to reveal her chosen companies!</p>
    <p>Strategy: 50% Low Risk + 30% Medium Risk + 20% High Risk</p>
    <p>Rachel spends her major part on low risk investments because she doesn't want to lose too much of her money. And
        when her medium and high risk inverstment earned her principal, she will put all of her profit into high risk
        inverstment and put all of her principal into low risk investment. At this point, Rachel minimize the
        possibility of losing her principal. Even all of her profits are lost in high risk inverstment, she still has
        her principal in low risk inverstment. Overall, Rachel increases the chance of earning more money and minimizes
        the
        possibility of losing her principal.

                        <button>Click to Mock Stock Market</button> </a>
                    <p>Nvidia is a famous technology company producing chips. As AI is developing quicker and quicker,
                        chips are becoming more and more important to any company that wants to work with AI. As a
                        result, Rachel believes Navidia company will earn positive profit. She has a positive view of
                        Navidia company in the future. </p>
                    <p>Beside Rachel's subjective opinions of Navidia company's stock, the previous stock market data
                        also support Rachel's inverstment choice. According to Google Finance, ignoring the small amount
                        of increase or decrease, the overall trend of Nvidia's stock price is increasing in the past one
                        month, six months, 1 year, and 5 years. </p>

                    Chosen: <strong>Google's 40-year Corporate Bond</strong>

                    </a>
                    <p>Rachel choses to invest in Google's 40-year Corporate Bond because it is reliable and has low
                        risk. Google has really high credit, which means the risk is really
                        low. This bond will be safe and stable, while offering Rachel a fixed interest payments. Rachel
                        wants to invest more technology-based companies, which Google is one of the most famouse big
                        tech
                        companies.</p>

                    Chosen: <strong>Disney "Duffy and Friends"</strong>
                    <p>Disney Duffy and Friends series is famous of the cute character designs. One of the characters is
                        LinaBell, a cute and clever pink fox has a lot of fans around the world. Rachel chooses to
                        invest in
                        Duffy and Friends dolls, especially LinaBell, because she likes these characters and their value
                        can
                        increase 10 times or more in just a few months. This means Rachel can enjoy collecting these
                        dolls in
                        her daily
                        life, and if she sees the price go up a lot, she can sell them earn money. However, this
                        investment
                        also comes with
                        high risk. Why? Let's talk about why the dolls can be so expensive. Not everyone can buy these
                        dolls easily at Disneyland. To access the store, visitors often have to enter a lottery system,
                        and only those selected are allowed to shop. This limited access makes the price really high.
                        But if
                        Disney suddenly decides to open the store
                        to everyone, the prices can drop sharply. Since noboday can predict Disney's actions, so Rachel
                        always
                        faces a high risk that she might but a doll at a high price.<br> However, Rachel won't spend too
                        much money here since there's only a few designs for LinaBell every season. So Rachel won't face
                        a risk that might cause her lost a lot of money.</p>

                    Chosen: <strong>Condo in Vancouver</strong>
                    <p>Rachel choose to invest in a condo in Vancouver. Although housing prices are rencently
                        decreasing,
                        this provides Rachel an oppotunity to enter the market at a lower price. Vancouver is considered
                        one of the
                        best cities for people to live in the world. And its housing market is likely to grow in the
                        long run. As a result, investing in house in Vancouver has a medium risk. Unlike stocks, houses
                        are what people can actully use, such as living in, so the price won't decrease too much. </p>
